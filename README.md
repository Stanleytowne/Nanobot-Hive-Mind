Nanobot Hive Mind extends [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) with a **multi-agent orchestration layer** — a lightweight router that dynamically creates, manages, and coordinates specialist agents, each with their own model, memory, and session context.

Instead of one monolithic agent trying to do everything, Hive Mind routes each task to the right specialist with the right model at the right cost.

## Why Multi-Agent?

A single AI agent handling all your tasks is simple — but fundamentally wasteful. Here's why a multi-agent architecture is more effective:

### Context Isolation

A typical user juggles many different tasks: coding, research, scheduling, Q&A. These tasks are often concurrent and unrelated. Routing all of them through a single agent **contaminates the context window** — a coding conversation polluted with scheduling history degrades performance on both. Hive Mind gives each specialist its own session, so every agent operates with a clean, focused context.

### Intelligent Memory

Because every message passes through the orchestrator first, it acts as a **triage layer for knowledge**. The router proactively extracts personal facts (timezone, preferences, project context) from every message and commits them to shared long-term memory — something a single agent busy with "real work" does inconsistently. Each specialist also maintains private memory relevant to its domain, so a coding agent remembers your codebase while a reminder agent knows your schedule.

### Cost Efficiency

Not every task needs the most powerful model. A simple greeting doesn't require the same compute as a complex coding task. Hive Mind assigns **model tiers per task** — cheap/fast models for classification and chat, expensive models for analysis and coding. If a cheaper model can't handle a task (hits iteration limits), the system **auto-upgrades** to the next tier and retries, preserving the full session. You get strong-model quality only when you need it.

### Fault Isolation

When a specialist gets stuck or produces poor output, it doesn't affect other agents' work. The system detects failures (max iterations reached) and can auto-upgrade that one agent — while other specialists continue uninterrupted. You can also manually stop, restart, or upgrade individual agents without losing progress elsewhere.

### True Parallelism

A single agent is inherently sequential. Hive Mind can **split a multi-part request** and dispatch tasks to different specialists concurrently. A coding agent and a research agent can work on different parts of the same request simultaneously, then return results independently.

### Specialist Continuity

Each agent accumulates domain-specific context over time. A "coding" agent builds up understanding of your codebase across conversations; a "research" agent retains your research threads. A single generalist would dilute this accumulated expertise with unrelated context from other tasks.

### Graceful Scaling

Adding a new capability means creating a new specialist — not bloating a single agent's system prompt. Agents are created and destroyed dynamically based on demand, with a configurable cap on active specialists.

**Message flow:** Channel → MessageBus → Orchestrator (classify + route) → Specialist Agent(s) → Response → Channel

The orchestrator uses a **cheap/fast model** purely for routing — it never generates end-user responses. Specialist agents use independently assigned models matched to their task complexity.

### Memory Architecture

```
~/.nanobot/workspace/
├── memory/                    # Shared global (all agents read)
│   ├── MEMORY.md              # Long-term facts, always loaded
│   └── HISTORY.md             # Append-only event log
├── agents/                    # Per-agent isolated state
│   ├── coding/

```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stanleytowne/Nanobot-Hive-Mind.git
cd Nanobot-Hive-Mind
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

**1. Initialize**

```bash
nanobot onboard
```

**2. Configure** (`~/.nanobot/config.json`)

Set your API key and enable the orchestrator:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-v1-xxx"
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
      "provider": "openrouter"
    },
    "orchestrator": {
      "enabled": true,
      "routerModel": "stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free",
      "models": [
        "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
        "x-ai/grok-4.1-fast",
        "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5"
      ],
      "maxSpecialists": 10
    }
  }
}
```

The `models` array is sorted cheapest → most capable. The router uses a free/cheap model (`step-3.5-flash`) purely for classification, then assigns model tiers per task and auto-upgrades when needed.

**3. Connect a channel and run**

```bash
nanobot gateway
```

See [Chat Apps](#chat-apps) for channel setup (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.).
